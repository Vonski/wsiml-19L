# Different approaches for computing gradient, the parellelization and analysis

Today I finally completed the Machine Learning course from Coursera. The course at the end explain the difference between batch, stochastic and minibatch gradients, describe how one can parallelize computations and how to perform ceiling analysis on ml system pipeline.
