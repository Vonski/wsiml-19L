# Statistical inference, Deep Q Learning a.k.a. DQN and env preparation

Today I continued reading statistics book. Things are getting serious with the basics of statistical inference, which I feel intuitively but don't know anything about the formal definitions.

Also, I read some articles about Q Learning and Deep Q Learning. On a quest to implement the second one with Experience Replay for the better understanding of RLs algorithms. For me, it's the part of the research I do for my master thesis.
