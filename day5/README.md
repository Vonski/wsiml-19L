# *pandas* part 2

Finally, I've managed to test some other stuff from *pandas*. Hope to finalize my *pandas* overview in three days.

I've also read some stuff from the statistics book. It's again a recap of specific probability distributions but still quite challenging to follow everything that's said in the book.
